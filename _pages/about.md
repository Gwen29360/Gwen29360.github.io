*L'intelligence chez l'homme, quoiqu'il en soit pourvu, il a toujours l'impression d'en avoir assez, vu que c'est avec ça qu'il juge.* (Coluche)

About Me
======
I am currently a Research Associate at the [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu) in the [Geophysics department](https://geophysics.mines.edu). I am a member of the Mines Oceanography Team led by [Bia Villas Bôas](https://biavillasboas.github.io). I got a Ph.D in space and physical oceanography, delivered by the University of Western Brittany.

I use numerical wave model, spaceborne/airborne remote sensing, and in situ observations to better understand the role of the surface waves on the Global Climate and more particularly how they interact with the upper oceans.

I am passionate about surface gravity waves and geophysical fluid dynamics. I love field work and learn how to build low-cost instruments that can be deployed easily from a plateform or a research vessel.

When I'm not working, I enjoy surfing, but since I've moved to the Colorado Mountains, I've replaced this activity with trail running and hiking. I play the accordion and drums. Additionally, since my undergrad I have been involved in different volunteering missions that I'm still pursuing today.
