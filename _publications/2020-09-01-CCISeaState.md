## Overview

The Global Climate Observing System has listed “Sea State” as an Essential Climate Variable. Because of the need of having sea state observations on the global scale, the European Space Agency (ESA) funded the initiative to gather sea state observations from space under the Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The paper presents the accuracy of the dataset with respect to in-situ wave observations, denoising method on the altimeters-derived significant wave height, and many applications (extremes, spatial variability of the sea state).
