## Overview

During my Ph.D., I worked with Professor Fabrice Ardhuin on examining the influence of surface currents on significant wave height. I conducted simulations with spectral wave models, followed by comparisons between model outputs and altimeter observations. Prior to comparison, I applied denoising techniques using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method  [here](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1929/2020/). The primary objective of this research was to elucidate the connections between the magnitude of surface current gradients and significant wave height gradients, and to ascertain if we could accurately replicate the observed significant wave height gradients obtained from altimeter data.
