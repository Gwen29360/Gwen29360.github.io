## Overview

During my Ph.D I worked with Pr. Fabrice Ardhuin on the signature of surface current on the significant wave height. I ran spectral wave models that I subsequently compare the model outputs with altimeter observation, denoised before hand using EMD method [here](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1929/2020/). The aim of this work was to understand what are the relationships between the intensity of surface current gradients and significant wave height gradients and if we can reproduce the significant wave height gradient observed withh the altimeter.
